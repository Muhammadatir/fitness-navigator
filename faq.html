                                <p>BMI (Body Mass Index) is a numerical value derived from your weight and height. It's a screening tool that can indicate whether you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on your body mass relative to your height.</p>
                                <p>The formula for BMI is: weight (kg) / [height (m)]Â²</p>
                                <p>BMI Categories:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Below 18.5:</strong> Underweight</li>
                                    <li><strong>18.5-24.9:</strong> Normal weight</li>
                                    <li><strong>25.0-29.9:</strong> Overweight</li>
                                    <li><strong>30.0 and above:</strong> Obese</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>BMI is important because it helps determine your general health risk and guides appropriate diet and exercise recommendations. However, it's important to note that BMI is just one factor and doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density, or overall body composition.</p>

                                <p>Non-vegetarian diet plans incorporate animal protein sources like lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy, which provide complete proteins and are naturally rich in vitamins like B12 and minerals like iron in highly bioavailable forms.</p>

                                    <li><strong>For dairy allergies:</strong> Replace dairy milk with almond, soy, or oat milk; use plant-based yogurts and dairy-free cheese alternatives.</li>

                                    <li><strong>For nut allergies:</strong> Replace nuts with seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, or sesame) or legumes for protein and healthy fats.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For soy allergies:</strong> Use other legumes, meat (if non-vegetarian), or seitan as protein alternatives.</li>

                                <p>If you have access to a gym, you'll have all the equipment needed. For home workouts, many exercises can be modified to use bodyweight or household items. The most important thing is consistency rather than having perfect equipment.</p>

                                <p>A proper warm-up is essential for preventing injuries and optimizing performance. We recommend the following warm-up routine before starting your workout:</p>
                                
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>5-10 minutes of light cardio:</strong> Jogging in place, jumping jacks, jump rope, or brisk walking to increase heart rate and blood flow to muscles.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Dynamic stretching:</strong> Unlike static stretching (holding a position), dynamic stretching involves movement and helps prepare the muscles you'll be using in your workout. Include:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Arm circles (forward and backward)</li>
                                            <li>Leg swings (forward/back and side to side)</li>
                                            <li>Hip circles</li>
                                            <li>Torso twists</li>
                                            <li>Walking lunges with a twist</li>
                                            <li>Bodyweight squats</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Movement-specific preparation:</strong> Perform 1-2 sets of the first few exercises in your workout with very light weight or just bodyweight to practice the movement pattern.</li>
                                </ol>
                                
                                <p>After your workout, cool down with 5-10 minutes of light activity followed by static stretching, holding each stretch for 20-30 seconds.</p>

                                <p>Results vary based on individual factors including genetics, starting fitness level, consistency, diet adherence, sleep quality, and stress levels. However, here's a general timeline of what you might expect:</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>First 2-4 weeks:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Improved energy levels and mood</li>
                                    <li>Better sleep quality</li>
                                    <li>Increased strength (neurological adaptation rather than muscle growth)</li>
                                    <li>Possibly a slight weight change, though this could be water weight</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p><strong>1-3 months:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Noticeable improvements in strength and endurance</li>
                                    <li>Possible visible changes in body composition</li>
                                    <li>Clothes fitting differently</li>
                                    <li>Improved resting heart rate and recovery</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p><strong>3-6 months:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Significant changes in body composition</li>
                                    <li>Substantial strength and endurance gains</li>
                                    <li>Noticeable muscle definition (depending on goals)</li>
                                    <li>Improved flexibility and mobility</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>The key to seeing results is consistency. It's better to follow the plan 80% consistently for six months than to follow it 100% for two weeks and then quit. Remember that fitness is a lifelong journey, not a short-term fix.</p>
